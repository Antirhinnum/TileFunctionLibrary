# TileFunctionLibrary
## Usage
You must make a strong reference to this mod to use it. [Read more here.](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Expert-Cross-Mod-Content#strong-references-aka-modreferences-expert)

After that, all of the interfaces you'll need are in the `TileFunctionLibrary.API` folder. Simply make your `ModTile` class implement the interfaces and you'll be good to go.
