Adds a variety of interfaces to emulate vanilla tile functions on ModTiles.
This mod does nothing by itself and must be used by other mods to work.

See the [url=https://github.com/Antirhinnum/TileFunctionLibrary]source on GitHub[/url] for Mod.Call methods and API references.

Currently supports:
[list][*]Allowing the player to place extractibles into tiles (Extractinator).
[*][b]1.4.4 only:[/b] Allowing the player to treat tiles like the Chlorophyte Extractinator.[/list]
